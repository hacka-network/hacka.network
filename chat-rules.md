# Rules/Guidelines for the Hacka* Telegram Chat

## On-topic:

- Share your wins (like a revenue milestone)
- Share something that you shipped or built
- Getting feedback on your app or project
- Tech questions or help related to your app or project (but please try ChatGPT first)
- Sharing interesting tech stuff (within reason, should be somehow related to building apps/startups)

## Possible reasons for getting removed:

- Consistently causing drama or arguments or posting off-topic stuff
- Bullying/harrassment/spam
- Posting about illegal/dodgy stuff (e.g. bot farms)
- Often giving advice on topics without any personal experience or expertise on that topic
- Participating in the chat despite not actively building an app/startup/project that is tech-related either part-time, full-time or as a side project (these do not count: info products, e-commerce sites, dropshipping, SEO content farms, agencies, freelancing, your developer day job)
