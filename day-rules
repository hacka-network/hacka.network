# Guidelines for attending Hacka* events

## Getting invited

- Join one of the events via the website (https://hacka.network/)
- You're welcome to join if you're working on your own projects
- We usually don't accept people who are working on non-coding projects (eg info products, SEO content farms etc) or ethically gray products (eg bot-farms)
- We usually don't accept people who are just working remotely for a company or freelancing

## Morning intros

- Attend intros if you can
- Intros is like a daily standup, you should:
  - introduce yourself and your product (briefly)
  - tell the group what you'll be working on today
- To keep intros short, questions/discussions/breakouts can happen after everyone has finished their intro

## Lunchtime

- No rules, exchange ideas, talk about your dreams, go wild!

## Afternoon demos

- Anyone who introduced themselves at intros is welcome to give a demo 
- If it's your first time we encourage you to demo!
- Demos **should** consist of the task that was discussed at intros (consistency is nice)
- Demos **should not** be a pitch of your product - short one sentence elevator pitch is ok, but we're not your customers

## Evening

- Usually we go for dinner 
- Drinking optional
- Plus-one's welcome
- Celebrate the day’s achievements and get to know everyone!
